# DeepLense Tests

This repository has my attempts for the ML4SCI DeepLense tests. I am interested in 2 projects at DeepLense
1. [Deep Regression Techniques for Decoding Dark Matter with Strong Gravitational Lensing](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2023/proposal_DEEPLENSE2.html)
2. [Superresolution for Strong Gravitational Lensing](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2023/proposal_DEEPLENSE6.html)

The folders have been organised in the order of tests. 
1. Test 1 - This has the notebook containing my solution for "Common Test I. Multi-Class Classification"
2. Test 3 - This has the notebook containing my solution for "Specific Test III. Learning Mass of Dark Matter Halo"
3. Test 6 - This has the notebook containing my solution for "Specific Test VI. Image Super-resolution"

All code has been implemented in PyTorch and run on Google Colab.
